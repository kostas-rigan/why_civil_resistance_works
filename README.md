# why_civil_resistance_works
This project was part of the 2nd assignment of Applied Machine Learning course in the Department of Management Science and Technology in AUEB. The purpose was to explore and replicate the findings of [Why Civil Resistance Works](https://www.ericachenoweth.com/research/wcrw) by Erica Chenoweth and Maria J. Stephan, using the [NAVCO 1.2. Dataset](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/0UZOTX).

## Findings Replication
Some of the tasks were to replicate various findings from Chenoweth's and Stephan's work, such as:
* **Exploration of Historical Trends**
* **Largest Resistance Campaigns, 1946-2014**
* **The Effect of Participation on the Probability of Campaign Success**

Apart from replicating these findings, I also had to explore the dataset more by:
* **Finding The Level of Participation Tipping Point** and
* **Examining Nonviolent Resistance and Target Regime Type**

## Modules Used
In this projects the following modules were used to assist the analysis:
* **numpy** to use mathematical functions such as log
* **pandas** for data manipulation and transformation
* **matplotlib** to create detailed and highly customized plots
* **seaborn** for faster and pretty graphs and
* **statsmodels** to create Logistic Regression models
